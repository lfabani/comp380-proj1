Perceptron

The input file should be formatted as follows:

line 1: number of input neurons i
line 2: number of output neurons o
line 3: number of training samples n
line 4: //blank line
line 5: training sample 1 //can be all on one line or split up into lines of equal length
line 6: //blank line
line 7: output vector
line 8: alias which the output vector represents
line 9: //blank line

Lines 5-9 are repeated n times, once for each sample listed in line 3


The output data file contains o lines of i trained weights (type: float) followed by one line of o trained bias weights (type: float), each weight separated by a space. It then contains a blank line, the chosen alpha, blank line, the chosen theta, blank line, and the chosen convergence threshold
